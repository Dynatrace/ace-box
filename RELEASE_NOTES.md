# ACE-BOX Release notes

## v1.10.0 - January 2022

### New Features

#### AppSec Quality Gate / Security Gate
A new pipeline set has been integrate to demonstrate AppSec Quality Gates!
[#116](https://github.com/Dynatrace/ace-box/issues/116)

#### Provisioning improvements
Improvements in provisioning and updating ace-box instances.
[#58](https://github.com/Dynatrace/ace-box/issues/58)

In a nutshell:

- Unified provisioning: Terraform for cloud + Vagrant instances (Vagrant legacy can be used as well)
- Ansible cleanup: Move playbooks and related config (e.g. variables) into roles
- Installation: install.sh is split into:
   - init.sh: runs some essentials (e.g. apt-get update, install Ansible, ... + "ace-cli"). This usually needs to be run once for every ACE-box and is included in the Terraform provisioners.
   - "$ ace prepare": Adds VM specific settings (e.g. ingress domain). This usually needs to be run once for every ACE-box and is included in the Terraform provisioners.
   - "$ ace install ": Installs ACE-Box components, e.g. "all", "microk8s", ...
Please see the README for additional info.

## v1.9 - July 2021

### New Features

#### Custom domains support
[#3](https://github.com/Dynatrace/ace-box/issues/3)

This allows you to use custom domains, either directly in terraform or by running the install script on a VM.

#### Canary Release and Auto Remediation usecase
[#11](https://github.com/Dynatrace/ace-box/issues/11) and [#20](https://github.com/Dynatrace/ace-box/issues/20)

You can now demo a canary deployment together with auto remediation using the ACE-BOX. This will use Jenkins, Nginx Ingress and AWX to drive the workflow. Check out the new usecase from the ACE Dashboard!
> Note: this usecase works only on a cloud ace-box as Dynatrace has to be able to send the problem back to AWX

#### AWX
[#11](https://github.com/Dynatrace/ace-box/issues/11) and [#20](https://github.com/Dynatrace/ace-box/issues/20)

AWX Is used by the Auto Remediation usecase and thus also gets installed on the ACE-BOX.

#### Complete demo walkthrough
[#29](https://github.com/Dynatrace/ace-box/issues/29)

On the ACE Dashboard there is now a detailed walkthrough for the demo scenarios of MaaS/Quality Gates and also Canary/Auto Remediation.

### Fixes/tech updates

#### K8s 1.21
[#38](https://github.com/Dynatrace/ace-box/issues/38)

Microk8s has been upgraded from 1.18/stable to 1.21/stable. This was done for tech currency reasons and also to support the canary scenario using the nginx ingress controller

#### Update AWS Instance Type to T3
[#15](https://github.com/Dynatrace/ace-box/issues/15)

#### Added CODEOWNERS
[#21](https://github.com/Dynatrace/ace-box/issues/21)

## v1.8 - June 2021

This is the last version of the ACE-BOX to be published in BitBucket. From now on, the repository will be maintained in https://github.com/Dynatrace/ace-box. You need a GitHub account linked to the Dynatrace org to gain access. Please lodge an EDE ticket.

### New features

#### Azure and AWS support for Cloud Edition
Following on the first release of ACE-BOX CE, support for Azure and AWS using terraform has now been added. Check out the **microk8s/terraform** folder for more info. Terraform config has also been restructured.

#### Basic authentication for ACE Dashboard
Since the dashboard prints user names and tokens for gitea and other services, basic authentication has been added. User name and password are set to `dynatrace` by default but can be changed by setting the `acebox.config.dashboard.user` and `acebox.config.dashboard.password` in `config.yml`.

#### A brand new ACE Dashboard experience
We moved the ACE Dashboard to the barista framework to be in line with the Dynatrace design. At the same time, the goal is to make the ACE-BOX more approachable so we have made it even easier to get started!

#### Clean up step for Dynatrace Environment prior to deployment
An extra step has been added that deletes config from Dynatrace. At the moment the Kubernetes credentials for `127.0.0.1` and `ACE-BOX` are deleted to avoid conflicts with the new Dynatrace Operator and using a Dynatrace environment that was used prior for the ace-box.

#### GitLab CI Demo
By importing the ace/ace repo from Gitea into the (optional) GitLab environment, you can now showcase Quality Gates and event from within a GitLab environment.

### Fixes/tech updates
Updated python to v3 and ansible to latest version. Jenkins and plugins updated. Moved to new official Jenkins helm chart and updated to latest version of the chart as well.

### Simplenodeservice now uses nodejs 14
To avoid usage of an unsuported/EOL version of nodejs, simplenodeservice has now been updated to nodejs 14

### Keptn 0.8.4
Update to latest Keptn release and dependant services

## v1.7 - March 16 2021
### New features
#### ACE-BOX Cloud Edition
There is now the possibility to deploy the ACE-BOX on cloud providers using Terraform. For this first release GCP only is supported using Terraform.
A generic installation script is there to support any virtual machine with a public IP address and ports 80/443 exposed.
Check out the **microk8s/terraform** folder for more info.

#### Monaco installed on ACE-BOX
Additionally to being available on the Jenkins pipelines, monaco is now also available as the same-named command.
It is also used to deploy an ACE dashboard on Dynatrace instance.

#### ACE Dashboard on Dynatrace
As an alternative to the ACE-Dashboard that is deployed on Kubernetes, there is now also a Dynatrace dashboard containing all the links.

#### Helm chart to deploy SimpleNode Staging in ace pipeline
In the staging environment, a helm chart was introduced to deploy the simplenodeservice as opposed to traditional yaml file deployment. This will also facilitate the release inventory functionality in Dynatrace.

#### Support for release inventory
In preparation for the release of the new Release Inventory feature, the right kubernetes labels have been set to support version, component and application detection. The events have also been updated to show up on this screen.

#### New jmeter-runner template
Jenkins now uses a new ACE developed jmeter-runner pod template to fix known security issues. 

### Fixes
#### Keptn
Update `dynatrace-service` and `dynatrace-sli-service` to the latest version
Increased helm timeout for installation


## v1.6 - February 2021
### New features
#### Move to Dynatrace Operator
The OneAgent Operator was replaced with the Dynatrace Operator that will also install kubernetes monitoring on microk8s.

#### Addition of Monaco and Quality Gates Perform HOT sessions
The HOT sessions given by the ACE team at Perform around Monaco and Quality Gates are now added to the ace-box.
In Gitea you will see dedicated organizations for them as well.

#### Addition of true GitOps Monaco example
A demo flow for true GitOps with Monaco and Gitea has been created.
An onboarding pipeline exists for information gathering which then uses a template structure combined with an onboarding branch, pull request and approval to merge back into a goldmaster configuration branch.

### Fixes
#### Keptn
Update `dynatrace-service` and `dynatrace-sli-service` to the latest version
Increased helm timeout for installation

#### Gitea
Increased gitea ingress max size for commits

#### Updates
Technical update of plugins, keptn versions, images, etc.

#### Restructuring of Jenkins pipelines for HOT and Demo
There is now a clear strucutre in place for the demo and hands-on training usecases in Jenkins.

## v1.5 - January 2021
### New features
#### Gitlab support
Added support for gitlab! By setting `acebox.features.gitlab` to `true` it will be installed during `vagrant up`.

**NOTE:** Gitlab is quite heavy in resource consumption, even though it currently gets deployed in a "minimal" state. You might need to turn off certain features such as jenkins and/or the activegate to be able to run GitLab.

#### Kubernetes ActiveGate support
A new feature is the ability to deploy an ActiveGate using a container image and thus on a Kubernetes cluster. By setting `acebox.features.activegatekube` to `true` it will be installed during `vagrant up`. You can use this ActiveGate to set up Kubernetes monitoring, by pointing it to th endpoint [http://](https://192.168.50.10:16443/). The bearer token can be retrieved as per the documentation, it is also added as an environment variable to Jenkins so the integration can be configured using Monaco.

### Fixes
#### Reduce resource requests for simplenodeservice
By default, simplenodeservice, deployed using jenkins or gitlab, requested a fair bit of resources from kubernetes. This has now been drastically reduced to ensure that no pods end up in a Pending state
#### Update monaco to OSS
All references to "mac" have been removed and ace-box is now using the official OSS version of Monaco
#### Added ntp package
To fix a time drift issue due to either the host being hibernated and sometimes due to high VM CPU usage, ntp package was installed
