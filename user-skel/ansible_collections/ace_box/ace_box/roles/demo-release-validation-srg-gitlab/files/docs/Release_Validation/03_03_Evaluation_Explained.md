# 3. Evaluation Explained

In this section, we will examine the Release Validation process that prevents a bad build from being promoted to the production environment. We will look at the components involved, how they are configured, and how the `fail` result is calculated.

## Pipeline Flow

Let's start by examining the CI Pipeline in reverse order, from the last to the first stage.

1. The ultimate goal is to deploy a stable and reliable build to the production environment. The `3-Deploy App Production` job, located in the `Deploy Production` stage, is responsible for installing the app-simplenode into the production environment. Additionally, the `4-Send DT Deploy Event Production` notifies Dynatrace about this deployment, which can be viewed on the `Releases` page.

   However, before we can proceed to this stage, we need to ensure that the build in the staging environment is of sufficient quality to be promoted to the production environment. This is where the `Validate Release` stage comes into play.

2. For the Release Validation, one single job is enough:
   
   `Validate Release` stage `Validate Release with SRG` job: here it will send an event to trigger a `Workflow` to perform an evaluation through `Site Reliability Guardian` and process the results. 
   If you click on the job to see the job logs, you will notice `DT automation` tool is leveraged to perform the evaluation. For the details, please click here: [dynatrace-automation-tools](https://github.com/dynatrace-ace/dynatrace-automation-tools/blob/10-feature-poc-srg-execute-evaluation/docs/Site-Reliability-Guardian/SRGAutomation.md)

     SRG evaluation is performed by `dta` CLI. Evaluation start and end time are given as inputs to the Site Reliability Guardian to evaluate the application within the time period that the performance test was executed.

      ```
      eval_start=$(cat srg.test.starttime)
      eval_end=$(cat srg.test.endtime)
      dta srg evaluate --service $SRG_EVALUATION_SERVICE --stage $SRG_EVALUATION_STAGE --start-time=$eval_start --end-time=$eval_end
      ```

     `dta srg evaluate` command sends a [bizevent](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/platform-modules/business-analytics/apps/explore-business-events) on behalf of you with the environment variables given as the inputs in the `.gitlab-ci.yaml` file:
    
        ```
        SRG_EVALUATION_SERVICE: "simplenode" 
        SRG_EVALUATION_STAGE: "staging"
        DYNATRACE_URL_GEN3: $DT_PLATFORM_TENANT_URL
        ACCOUNT_URN: $DT_OAUTH_ACCOUNT_URN
        DYNATRACE_CLIENT_ID: $DT_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID
        DYNATRACE_SECRET: $DT_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET
        DYNATRACE_SSO_URL: $DT_OAUTH_SSO_ENDPOINT
        ```
   ![gitlab-cicd](assets/gitlab_cicd_pipeline_success_jobdetails_send_event.png)

   The bizevent that is sent to Dynatrace will trigger the particular (distingished by SRG_EVALUATION_SERVICE: "simplenode" AND SRG_EVALUATION_STAGE: "staging") [Workflow](../Workflow_SRG/README.md#3-create-a-dynatrace-workflow) which contains a [Site Reliability Guardian](../Workflow_SRG/README.md#2-create-a-new-guardian). `Dynatrace automation tool` waits for the evaluation result which is another bizevent that is generated after the SRG validation is finished. You can query it via `Dynatrace Notebook` as in the following DQL statement.

      ```
      fetch bizevents 
      | filter event.type == "guardian.validation.finished" AND contains(execution_context,"<AUTO-GENERATED EVENT ID WHEN TRIGGERING THE WORKFLOW>")
      | sort timestamp desc
      | limit 1
      ```

   After a short while, the validation is completed with a result that shows the validation status, summary and the other details. You can also click on the `Evaluation Link` to see the results directly into the SRG page:
