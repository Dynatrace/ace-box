TBD:
- Consolidate content from Mark's current content and https://github.com/dynatrace-ace/perform2021-vhot-monaco
  in user-skel/repos/hot/hot-monaco-gitops
- Subtitute variables in hot-monaco-gitops-jobs.yml.j2 with ones that are currently used (see demo-default-jobs.yml.j2)
- Check credential sourcing in Jenkins pipelines (e.g. user-skel/repos/ace/jenkins/mac.Jenkinsfile)
